>Programming languages and what we used?

    >Programming languages are language tools to communicate with computer. 
     Programming languages allow computers to process complex commands.
     For exmaple if computer is given a large amount of data and a person codes way of parsing it and pass it to the computer, it will automatically understand the language and parse the data. 
     Each language has it's own unique features, teh examples can be C, JAVA, Python and etc. 
     As a computer science major students we have focused on using JAVA. 
     The main reason was that most major courses are either in C or JAVA and we found JAVA was more comfortable than C. 

>>Requirements for the Project1 and what we used or did

    >swift coding

        >Using swift coding was the requirement for project1 part1_A and B. 
        Through swift we created a method to change Roman numerals to Arabic numbers.
        For part A, we set cases of combination fo Roman numerals such as M, CM, L, IX, and etc.
        we parse through the Roman numerals and find a matching string and add the value 
        according to the string.
        For part B, there are some restrictions in printing out the Arabic numbers. 
        Those were the Roman numeral had to be in descending order.
        Second was Roman numeral cannot be repeated 5 times.
        Lastly, Roman numeral V, L, D should not repeated in Roman numeral.
        In those cases we print out different output using emoticons. 
        In this part of the project, we learned way to learn the use of Unicode. 

    >> python

        For project1 part2_A and B we tried to use java but decided to change the programming language to python.  
        What we had to do for project1 part 2 were parsing a specific grammar and give out output by retaining and sorting the input written by specific grammar. 
        Using JAVA, we would have to go through every for loop to get the data and compare them and print out each error or output. 
        Yet, we figured out that usign python would be mroe time effective. 
        Especially in spliting the string value. In Java we have to attain the string value and cut it one by one, yet, in python we only need one line of saying split("by requiremnet")and it will automatically split the string by that requirement and gets the splitted strings that we need.

        In this part of the project, the way we reached the part 2 was to understand the grammar first and make
        an input file.
        We parsed through the input and divide them into strings so we could get the exact values.
        After dividing the strings, we compare them if there are any synthetic error. 
        If there are we print them out.
        In the second part of the project, we implement the grammar of the input. 
        By implementing we mean adding canceling the request.
        When the user request to buy or sell shares and call cancel, it will print out to cancel the request.

    >>>Markdown

        !![Markdown logo](https://raw.github.com/dcurtis/markdown-mark/master/png/208x128.png)

        >Before this project, we have never used the Markdown. We knew about it since in project every README file is in format of .md but we never really used it.  
        By reading the documentation that was given and searching online, we have figured way out to write this blog in markdown language. 
        Markdown language as what we have understood, is created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz. 
        They got inspired by email format to create markdown, instead of using html that contains various tags they invented markdown that translates the script to html.
        We feel like it is very easy to use even for programming beginner.
